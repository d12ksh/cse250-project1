# 🌐 Contact Us Web System

A simple full-stack web application where users can send messages through a Contact Us form. Messages are stored in a database and email notifications are sent to both the site owner and the user.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project shows how a basic web system works from front to back:

1️⃣ A user fills out a contact form  
2️⃣ The data is sent to a backend server  
3️⃣ The server stores the message in a database  
4️⃣ Email notifications are sent automatically

The goal is to understand how frontend, backend, and databases connect in a real web application.
